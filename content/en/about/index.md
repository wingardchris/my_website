I received my JD/MBA with Honors from Boston University and now work as an Associate at Morgan Lewis. I'm admitted to practice law in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.  

Previously, I studied at Pembroke College, Oxford University and Tufts University, where I graduated summa cum laude with a double major in Economics and Environmental Studies. I was also selected a [Tufts Senior Award Winner](https://alumniandfriends.tufts.edu/join-our-community/about-alumni-association/2019-senior-awards-honorees)  and inducted into the [Phi Betta Kappa](https://ase.tufts.edu/pbk/index_files/Page352.htm) honors society.

I'm interested in the power of law to create a more just, sustainable, and equitable economy. I've written extensively on social justice topics at the intersection of law and business, such as climate risk and employee ownership. To learn more about these and other topics, please peruse my writings [here](/blog/krabby_patty/)

Outside of my professional life, I love cooking and experimenting with various fermented foods.

During my eclectic life, I've also:

* Led an Eagle Scout project to prevent Cape Cod beach erosion; 
* Worked on a small-scale organic farm in Ecuador; 
* Learned to unicycle;
* Helped start the [Massachusetts Center for Employee Ownership](https://masseio-1.b12sites.com/);
* Hosted an [alternative homecoming dance](https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/provincetown-banner/2013/11/09/nauset-senior-s-alternative-dance/38345606007/) (Ã  la [Footlose](https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/169663/nauset-senior-holds-alternative-dance-after-school-administraion-banned-grinding-turned-on-lights-and-made-dance-miserable)); and
* Completed 6 Marathons
