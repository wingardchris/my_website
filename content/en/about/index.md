A JD/MBA graduate with honors from Boston University, I now work as an attorney at Morgan Lewis. I'm an effective communicator who enjoys team building, strategic planning, and project management.

I'm also a health-concious meditator who strives to promote sustainable and mindful living. :

I love experimenting in the kitchen, especially with fermented foods like sourdough and kombucha.

During my short life, I've:
* Led a project to prevent Cape Cod beach erosion; 
* Worked on a small-scale organic farm in Ecuador; 
* Learned to unicycle;
* Helped start the Massachusetts Center for Employee Ownership
* Hosted an alternative homecoming dance (a la Footlose); and
* Completed 6 Marathons (it took me 157.2 miles to realize running marathons is CRAZY and nobody should run that distance)

To learn more about these and other strange pursuits, please peruse my writings [here](/blog/krabby_patty/).
