## Where I have fun.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy activities that challenge me physically and mentally. I've developed resilience and flexibility through distance running and yoga. I meditate to stay grounded and explore consciousness. My love of cooking requires precision and creative expression. I also can unicycle, but my future in the circus is limited until I learn to juggle.
