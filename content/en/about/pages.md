## Where I have fun...

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy activities that challenge me physically and mentally. I love surfing, skiing, and being outside. I'm a mediocre runner, who (barely) managed to complete 6 marathons. My meditation and yoga practices keep me grounded and help me explore consciousness. I'm often found in the kitchen, where I brew kombucha and experiment with new recipes. I also can unicycle, but my future in the circus is limited until I learn to juggle. While juggling eludes me, I still manage to build community and bring people together through food and sometimes [dancing](https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/provincetown-banner/2013/11/09/nauset-senior-s-alternative-dance/38345606007/).
