## Where Iâ€™ve studied...
 
I studied at Pembroke College, Oxford University and Tufts University, where I graduated summa cum laude with a double major in Economics and Environmental Studies. At Tufts, I was selected a [Senior Award Winner](https://alumniandfriends.tufts.edu/join-our-community/about-alumni-association/2019-senior-awards-honorees)  and inducted into the [Phi Betta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/) honors society. I then received a full-tuition scholarship as an Early Decision Distinguished Scholar to attend Boston University, where I completed an accelerated JD/MBA and graduated with honors.
