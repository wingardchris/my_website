**A.  Introduction**

Research suggests that employee ownership offers substantial benefits
both to businesses and employee owners. Businesses enjoy increased
worker productivity, investment, company growth, and greater resiliency
against market trends. Employee owners, meanwhile, often benefit from
improved subjective well-being and greater wealth relative to their
non-owner peers. This blog post will outline some of the key benefits
workers enjoy as owners.

**B. Increased Employee Well-being**

Employee ownership has clear benefits to employee well-being. This form
of shared capitalism contributes to feelings of unity or that everyone
is on the same team working towards the common goal of joint prosperity.
Instead of a workplace demarcated by tensions between management and
employees, or owners and employees, employee owners enjoy a sense of
working together to acheive shared success. Employee owners report being
more satisfied with their jobs and more trusting of the firm and
management than their non-owner counterparts.[^1] This higher
satisfaction and trust may be derived from the fact that employee owners
enjoy greater job security than non-owners.[^2] Employee-owned
businesses are less likely to shed workers during economic downturns.
Incredibly, during the last two recessions employee owned companies laid
off half as many workers as peer firms.[^3]

Additionally, employee owners feel tangibly connected to their work. The
feeling of ownership can be deeply significant for those who seek
meaning and psychological connection from their work. The quest for
meaning is a universal human motive, and yet many struggle to find this
meaning in their work. Despite spending roughly 50% of awake hours at
work, in a 2018 Gallup survey only about 13% of adult Americans in
full-time employment reported that they were "truly engaged and had
meaningful work".[^4] As the old idiom goes, many people are just
punching the clock and counting down the hours until they're released
from work. Employee owners, even hourly workers who must regularly track
their time, are less inclined to view their work as drudgery and more
likely to find fulfillment in their day-to-day activities.[^5]

**C. Higher Employee wealth and retirement savings**

In addition to the psychological benefits of increased engagement and
well-being, employee ownership tangibly addresses the wealth gap by
decreasing the precarity of workers. Employee ownership is essentially a
financial instrument for workers to build wealth over time. Typically,
ESOP stock is awarded to employee owners at zero cost and then left to
increase in value as the company grows over the course of the employees'
tenure. Often, these employees will also utilize more traditional
vehicles for retirement savings, such as 401(k) plans.

The effects of employee ownership on worker income, wealth,
and retirement savings are staggering. The 2017 "Employee
Ownership and Economic Well-Being" report by the National Center for
Employee Ownership notes: "Among the sampled workers, all
ages 28 to 34, workers who are employee-owners have 92% higher median
household wealth and 33% higher income from wages."[^6] In an even
broader study, employee owners were found to have total retirement
assets worth 2.6 times the value of the assets of their peers.[^7] A
common critique of this wealth accumulation is that employee owners
enjoy wealth which is less diversified and thus more susceptible to risk
and erosion over time. While this critique may prove true in certain
circumstances, a portfolio analysis of various employee-owned accounts
has shown they exhibit sufficient levels of diversification and thus do
not overexpose their owners to risk.[^8]

The benefits of employee ownership for wealth accumulation are clearly
shown through the example of WinCo Foods, a small discount supermarket
in northern Oregon. WinCo has approximately 100 employees who have a
combined retirement savings of $100 million.[^9] In other words, many
of WinCo's employee owners, who work stocking shelves and
bagging groceries, have more than $1 million in retirement
savings.[^10] The astonishing success of WinCo's employee
owners should not be construed as an outlier, for employee-ownership
clearly and conclusively contributes to higher levels of financial
stability and wealth.

**D. Conclusion**

In short, employee ownership offers material psychological and financial
benefits to workers who are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to
participate in shared ownership structures.
