Employee ownership is a specific type of business structure
centered around worker ownership of either part or all of their
employing entity. Usually, employee ownership is structured as either a
worker cooperative, a worker collective, a typical employee stock
ownership plan, or a democratic employee stock ownership plan. These
four employee ownership models differ in the degree of control employee
owners are granted over management, corporate governance, and control of
profits.  

**A. Worker Cooperatives**

Worker cooperatives are radically different than conventional
corporations, because they are owned and controlled entirely by their
workers[^1]. These worker-owners utilize a one-member-one-vote basis to
elect the board of directors, which in turn oversees the management of
the cooperative. Thus, under the worker cooperative structure,
management is ultimately accountable to the worker owners, who have the
authority to make managerial changes via their control over the Board of
Directors. While democratic governance is used to ensure a commitment to
cooperative ideals, compensation differentials may exist across roles
and tenure. Importantly, all profits accrue to worker owners.

Like all companies, worker cooperatives seek to earn profits. But they
are also concerned with actualizing core values, such as
"self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality,
equity, and solidarity"[^2]. Worker cooperatives commonly outline
certain principles which, when adhered to, can ensure their commitment
to their core values.  

According to the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives, there are over
600 democratic workplaces in the United States which collectively employ
over 8,000 people and generate over \$400 million in annual
revenues.[^3] Typically, worker cooperatives employ between 20 and
several hundred employees. However, the largest worker cooperative in
the United States, Cooperative Home Care Associates based in New York,
boasts nearly 2,000 worker owners.[^4]

***Figure 2: Worker Collective Model[^6]***

Worker collectives are identical to worker cooperatives in that they are
democratically governed by worker owners, but they differ in the model
of governance.[^7] Unlike worker cooperatives, worker collectives eschew
hierarchical management systems. Instead of electing a board of
directors to hire management, worker collectives utilize a horizontal or
flat management structure whereby all workers are co-managers. In
effect, this non-hierarchical system means that the worker owners also
fulfill the role typically delegated to the board of directors.
Worker collectives will utilize either consensus-based decision making
or majority vote to determine their course of action. Consensus based
decision making can be a particularly cumbersome process, and so most
worker collectives will rigorously vet potential employee owners in
order to ensure some degree of ideological homogeneity. To further
facilitate cooperation across differentiated roles, worker owners in
collectives may opt to organize themselves into work groups based on
business function.

Worker collectives are rare in the United States, but one notable
example is Black Star Co-Op, a brewpub in Austin, Texas.[^8] As its
website proudly declares, "supporting Black Star Co-Op
means supporting livable wages, democratic workplaces, local farms, and
quality products from your community brewpub!"[^9]
