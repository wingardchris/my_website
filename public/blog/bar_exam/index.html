school graduates across the country will shift their attention to the
final hurdle to become a lawyer: the bar exam. Unfortunately, this
ultimate barrier to practice is designed to arbitrarily exclude
qualified individuals from the profession, bears no rational
relationship to the actual practice of law, and is harmful to consumers.
The bar exam should be abolished because it would increase access to the
profession, decrease legal costs for consumers, and have little to no
adverse effect on the quality of legal services provided by the market.</p><p>The bar exam, and the legal profession generally in America, is
predicated on the exclusion of women, people of color, religious
minorities, and immigrants. For nearly the first hundred years of this
country&rsquo;s history the path to becoming a lawyer mirrored that of other
professions: apprentice with an established practitioner.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> Even after
Isaac Royall Jr., a wealthy slave-owner, donated funds to create Harvard
Law School in 1817, most attorneys were still minted via the personal
connections and nepotism encouraged by the apprenticeship model.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> A
written bar exam wasn&rsquo;t even administered in the United States until
Massachusetts developed one in 1855.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> Eventually, the combination of
graduating from an accredited law school and completing a written bar
exam became prerequisites to practice.</p><p>While these requirements facially appear to be more egalitarian than an
apprenticeship system obviously conditioned on personal connections, in
fact they continued the exclusionary history of law in America.
According to the U.S. Census, of the 160,605 practicing lawyers in the
United States in 1930 only 1,247 were black.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> Women were similarly
excluded from the profession, with top schools such as Yale and Harvard
not formally admitting women until 1919 and 1950 respectively.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>
Today, graduating from an accredited law school and completing the bar
remain formidable barriers for any aspiring attorney. Bar prep courses
typically costs thousands of dollars and require hundreds of hours of
dedicated study time. Recent grads are forced to prepare for the exam as
though it were a full-time job. It is particularly challenging for
low-income graduates to manage these financial and time impositions.
Indeed, those without significant family support may consider that the
average debt of a law school graduate is $164,742 while the median
salary is only $70,000 and choose to forego the profession well before
they reach the final step of bar completion.<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup></p><p>Of course, those who choose to attend law school must then complete a
bar exam that bears no rational relationship to lawyer competence before
they are deemed &ldquo;competent&rdquo; to practice. After three years of schooling,
tens of law school exams, and countless hours of studying, the aspiring
attorney will only be deemed fit to practice on the results of a two-day
written examination. The bar covers such diverse topics as
constitutional law, business associations, trusts and estates, criminal
procedure, torts, and evidence.<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup> It is plausible that during some
bygone era of legal practice in America it was necessary for the
&ldquo;small-town&rdquo; lawyer to have some minimal competency in every field of
law. Yet contemporary legal practice has kowtowed to the edict of
capitalism: specialize. Most modern lawyers will focus their practice on
one or perhaps two niches of doctrinal law. Indeed, a single lawyer
offering the full suite of legal services tested on the bar would
arguably violate ABA Rule 1.1 on competence.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup> Surely, many law school
graduates&rsquo; careers will touch upon <em>something</em> that&rsquo;s tested on the bar.
Even so, the bar&rsquo;s testing of this subject is at best redundant to what
that student already studied in law school or would learn on the job.</p><p>In addition to being an arbitrary barrier to the practice of law, the
bar is also harmful to consumers. The legal community, much like a
cartel, enjoys price premiums for its services due to its limited size.
The higher the barriers to entry, the fewer attorneys will enter
practice. This relatively low labor supply restricts consumer choice and
allows attorneys to impose excessive costs for their services. The bar
exam is a critical component of this unnecessary edifice. Graduating
from a four-year college and three-year law school is an enormous
barrier which sufficiently excludes the most disenfranchised members of
American society from even considering becoming a lawyer. Of those who
make the significant investment to attend law school, roughly 20% of
first-time test-takers will then fail the bar and are thus still
excluded from legal practice.<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup></p><p>Surely, some may argue that bar exam is a necessary barrier that
prevents unqualified law school graduates from practicing law. This
argument suffers from two deficiencies. First, it adopts a paternalistic
view of consumers. Much of the American economy is predicated on free
market principles meant to maximize individual choice. Regulations
curtail this market activity in ways that are meant to protect consumers
and promote efficiency. Unfortunately, the bar exam does little to
signal to consumers that an attorney is suitable to meet their legal
needs. Second, removing bar-passage as a prerequisite to practice would
not materially decrease the quality of legal services being supplied to
the public, because the exam bears little or no relationship to the
actual practice of law. Consumers ought to be trusted to find a legal
practitioner suitable to their needs; whether that person passed a
two-day exam on a laundry list of legal topics is irrelevant.</p><p>If the American legal community wants to turn the page on its racist,
sexist, and classist history, then the bar exam must be abolished. This
simple act will increase access to the profession while not adversely
impacting the interests of the public. The barriers to join the legal
profession are more than steep enough. It is time the legal cartel
loosened its grip, opened its doors to more diverse members, and
acknowledged that doing so is necessary to meet the legal needs of
Americans.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Goforth, C. (2015). Why the Bar Examination Fails to Raise the
