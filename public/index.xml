Are societies with greater or lesser amounts of inequality more productive?&amp;rdquo;
The precise relationship between the welfare state and economic efficiency is challenging to ascertain, as ideological bias may suggest explanations that are politically expedient but have little resemblance to reality. This challenge remains for even the most neutral observer, who may be befuddled by incomplete data sets, exogenous economic shocks, or confounding variables which collectively muddy the waters.</description></item><item><title>Climate Change Policy Action</title><link>/blog/climate-_change_policy_action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/climate-_change_policy_action/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Since there is such scientific uncertainty about global warming, it is unreasonable to take any drastic policy steps. Do you agree?&amp;rdquo;
It is unreasonable to suggest that there is significant scientific uncertainty surrounding global warming. Consequently, it would be nothing short of reckless for humanity to refuse to implement drastic policy changes to address the causal relationship between our actions and the Earth&amp;rsquo;s changing climate.
